Add your music files here as MP3s:

- bloc-party.mp3
- blur.mp3
- coldplay.mp3
- enter-shikari.mp3
- elc.mp3
- idlewild.mp3
- muse.mp3
- oasis.mp3
- saving-aimee.mp3

The music player will work without these files but will show console errors.
You can use any MP3 files - they don't have to be from these specific artists!

To disable the music player entirely, remove or comment out the MusicPlayer component in app/page.tsx
